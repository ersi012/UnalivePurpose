# Unalive Purpose 

This RPG game built in Unity allows the user who is playing as a ghost character, to eliminate all enemies within a given time. The player wins the game by successfully removing all enemies before the time runs out, and the player loses if the time has concluded and there are enemies still remaining.

Here are some visuals of the game:
